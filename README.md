**Bias Beyond Magnitude: Regression Diagnostics for Functional Approximations**  
*Thomas Subia*

---

## Overview

This repository contains all R code necessary to reproduce the numerical experiments, functional approximation comparisons, and regression-based diagnostic analysis described in the manuscript. All data used in the study are **generated programmatically** from within the included scripts — no external datasets are required.

The work introduces a regression-diagnostic lens for evaluating functional approximations, using absolute bias as a performance measure under stochastic sampling. Emphasis is placed on distinguishing *magnitude collapse* from *true approximation quality*, particularly for Generalized Binomial Expansions (GBE).
